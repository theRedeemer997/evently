## Rules to follow before you commit the code

- Please do not commit the code directly to `main` branch.
- We have total of three iterations and so for each iteration we are going to create a feature branch for that, `feature-iteration-x`, to which we will be merging all our code after testing at the end of iteration.
- Next, if you working on any feature lets say login , create a `feature branch` called `feature-login` and then do the code changes and commit the code changes there , once done with the changes and if everything looks good , raise a PR to the iteration branch which we created at the starting of the iteration.
- Once we commit the code to the iteration branch , a rigourous testing needs to be performed on the code and then if everything looks okay, we will raise a final PR to the `main` branch.
- Once we have the entire code in the main branch , then there will be a deployment of code to live URL .
